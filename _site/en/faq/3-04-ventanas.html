<p>Estimates are a foolish and innocent approximation of what you might expect in the dining room line. It’ s not very accurate, we know it.
In the slider bar, you have to input the number of windows in front of you in the line. A window is literally a window. You can also think of them as columns, which are also throughout the dining room on both sides.
For example, from the turnstile (where you pass the card) to the men’s restrooms, the length of the line is 6 windows (you can count them). From one end of the dining room to the other there are 12 windows. The curve (of the main entrance) counts as one more window. So you can keep adding them until you reach the place where you are (up to the side entrance there are 25 windows).
This is a very experimental function. We chose the windows as a measure due to the changing nature of the line, the curves and counter-curves may vary from one day to another.</p>
