Estimates are a foolish and innocent approximation of what you might expect in the dining room row. It is not accurate, we know it.
The number of windows in front of you in the row is in the slider bar. A window is literally a window, you can also think of it as columns, they are along the dining room on both sides.
For example, from the pinwheel (where you pass the card) to the men's restrooms, the length of the row is 6 windows (count them), from one side of the dining room to the other there are 12 windows, the curve (of the main entrance) counts as one more window, and so you keep adding them until you reach the place where you are (up to the side entrance there are 25 windows).
This is an early experimental function. We choose the windows as measure by the changing nature of the row, the curves and countercurves may vary from day to day.
